# AICoursework
This is the coursework for the Artificial Intelligence module.
There are two chatbots included, in their separate folders.

Chatbot 1 satisifies part a and b, while Chatbot 2 satisfies part c and d, while inheriting the features from part a and b.

A) Rule-based and similarity-based conversation features. The chatbot can respond to the user, based on an AIML file and utilising pre-defined question and answer pairs. The similarity between a user input and the response required is calculated using a bag-of-words, tf/idf and cosine similarity. BONUS FEATURE: speech-based input from the user is provided for. 

B) Logical reasoning features. A simple first order logic knowledgebase and inference engine using the Natural Language Toolkit library. The user may check that a fact is true, update the knowledge base with "I know that" phrases or even evaluate the knowledge base to ensure that no information is contradictory. BONUS FEATURE: fuzzy logic implementation that allows for episodes of the topic (Supernatural) to be rated and an average calculated.

C) Local image classification model.

D) Cloud-based image classification service.

Chatbot 2 is currently under development and, as such, the full details are yet to be released.
